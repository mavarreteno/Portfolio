## Description

Here I am showcasing my budding skills in CSS as a budding programmer. We have at the very top the developer's name and a navigation section which is comprised of links which scroll to the rest of the sections. Furthur down we have a short and sweet "about me" section which highlights my lack of experience as a developer. Across from this we have the logo displayed.
Next there is the section of placeholders where my future accomplishments can be displayed. Lastly, is the contact me section with my email and a link to my github.
